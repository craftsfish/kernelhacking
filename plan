patch {
	ftrace {
		each time a trace is added, record comm is enabled, record happens when switch/record
		while trace is added, cat trace_pipe might be actived and comm is not record yet
		a more resonable solution should record comm before trace is commited, and disable current task record during a schedule slice
	}
	Documentation/trace/histogram.rst {
		1030, 字符串filter要加""
		确认代码解析逻辑
		1155, 需要改成>>
		1171, 应该是disable_event
	}
	drivers/devfreq/devfreq.c {
		如果devfreq必须有governor的话，卸载成功的前提必须是当前governor已经无人使用
	}
